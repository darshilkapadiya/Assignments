    "AnsB8 - Python doesn't have switch case statement because of Unsatisfactory Proposals. Most of the programming languages have switch/case because they don't have proper mapping constructs. you cannot map a value to a fucntion thats why they have it. But in python you can easily have a mapping table(dict) where a certain value maps to a certain function. Python functions are the first class values, you can use the functions as the values of the dictionary get(key[default]) Method. Performance wise, the python dictionary lookup will almost certainly be more efficient than any solution you can rig yourself."

    "AnsB9 -> An interpreter is a kind of program that executes other programs. When you write Python programs , it converts source code written the developer into intermediate language which is again translated into the native language / machine language that is executed.The python code you write is compiled into python bytecode, which creates file with extension .pyc . The bytecode compilation happened internally, and almost completely hidden from developer. Compilation is simply a translation step, and byte code is a lower-level, and platform-independent , representation of your source code. Roughly, each of your source statements is translated into a group of byte code instructions. This byte code translation is performed to speed execution byte code can be run much quicker than the original source code statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The .pyc file , created in compilation step, is then executed by appropriate virtual machines. The Virtual Machine just a big loop that iterates through your byte code instructions, one by one, to carry out their operations. The Virtual Machine is the runtime engine of Python and it is always present as part of the Python system, and is the component that truly runs the Python scripts . Technically, it's just the last step of what is called the Python interpreter."

    "B12. How memory is managed in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "AnsB12 - Understanding Memory allocation is important to any software developer as writing efficient code means writing a memory-efficient code. Memory allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to a program. In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers created a garbage collector for Python so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage collection is a process in which the interpreter frees up the memory when not in use to make it available for other objects. Assume a case where no reference is pointing to an object in memory i.e. it is not in use so, the virtual machine has a garbage collector that automatically deletes that object from the heap memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference counting works by counting the number of times an object is referenced by other objects in the system. When references to an object are removed, the reference count for an object is decremented. When the reference count becomes zero, the object is deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Let’s suppose there are two or more variables that have the same value, so, what Python virtual machine does is, rather than creating another object of the same value in the private heap, it actually makes the second variable point to that originally existing value in the private heap. Therefore, in the case of classes, having a number of references may occupy a large amount of space in the memory, in such a case referencing counting is highly beneficial to preserve the memory to be available for other objects.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### The lifetime of a namespace :\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "AnsB14 - Using loops in Python automates and repeats the tasks in an efficient manner. But sometimes, there may arise a condition where you want to exit the loop completely, skip an iteration or ignore that condition. These can be done by loop control statements. Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continue statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue is also a loop control statement just like the break statement. continue statement is opposite to that of break statement, instead of terminating the loop, it forces to execute the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "As the name suggests the continue statement forces the loop to continue or execute the next iteration. When the continue statement is executed in the loop, the code inside the loop following the continue statement will be skipped and the next iteration of the loop will begin."
